# Predictive maintenance using machine learning:

### introduction:
In various industries, the anticipation of equipment failure holds paramount importance in the context of predictive maintenance planning. 

Among these sectors, aerospace companies, in particular, find themselves significantly impacted by this matter, driven by their incessant pursuit of minimizing flight delays and enhancing operational efficiency.



### objective:
This project aims to explore and harness the potential of Artificial Intelligence within the realm of maintenance, seeking to underscore the paramount significance of its application in this domain.



### Data exploration:
The dataset consists of measurements collected from 100 aircraft engines, each equipped with 21 sensors. The collected data contains simulated run to failure events by Microsoft Cortana Intelligence. 

Condition monitoring of an engineâ€™s health using sensor data can facilitate equipment failure prediction.



### Model training:
Through the analysis of the aircraft engine's sensor data over time, the machine learning algorithm can discern patterns and correlations between sensor values and their fluctuations in relation to historical failures. 
* The label is set to TTF
  
Using a regression model, this project will attempt to anticipate equipment failure and eventually reduce down Time.
